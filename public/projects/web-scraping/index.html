        <p>My mom was a fan of a Taiwanese show, but the YouTube channel got geoblocked overnight. There were two solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Purchase a VPN</li>
<li>Torrent the episodes</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, Taiwanese VPNs were pretty expensive (I don&rsquo;t think the major VPN companies like PIA had servers in that region). I also had to have a Raspberry Pi route internet to the smart TV as mom wanted a frictionless experience, which was a little bit outside of my skillset at the time.</p>
<p>Armed with my grade school level Chinese, I managed to find a torrent site that had the episodes! Why not try my hand out at web scraping? I already had a Plex server running, and it wasn&rsquo;t much effort to interface with qBittorrent as there was already a Python library for it.</p>
<p>After a look around, <code>Beautiful Soup</code><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> was what people recommended. It was pretty pleasant to use! I used <code>Requests</code> to grab the search page, scraped the links, then grabbed all the links and scraped them for the magnets, using a text file to figure out what I&rsquo;d already scraped. Then I just popped them off to qBittorrent and it worked!</p>
<p>Now to schedule it. I didn&rsquo;t quite have much Linux experience at this point either so the simplicity of cron was great for beginner me. I made a bash script to call my python script once a day and it ran like clockwork.</p>
<p>The torrent site died after a few months, unfortunately, and I couldn&rsquo;t manage to find another source.</p>
<p>All things considered, this was a pretty fun experiment in scraping and basic cron scheduling! It got several months worth of shows for my mom so the effort was worth it.</p>
