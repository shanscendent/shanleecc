Hello!

My name is Shan, nice to meet you. You may recognize me as __shanscendent__ from Github.

I'm an engineer with experience in embedded microcontrollers and full stack development. Oh, and I also dabble in fun projects and photography.

Please check out my [portfolio](projects)!

Projects of note:
- TBA

My hobby site is at [shanscendent.com](https://shanscendent.com) (it's a bit out of order at the moment)

If you're interested in hiring or just want to connect, [get in touch!](contact)
